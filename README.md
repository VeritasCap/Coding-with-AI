# Coding with AI (AI輔助開發)
This depository collects the latest and most useful resources and notes about coding with AI. 
本倉庫收集了關於AI輔助開發的最新且最有用的資源和筆記。

### Building tools (開發工具)
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) - My personal favorite AI code editor. If you don't know which one to start with, this is a great choice. 我最喜歡的AI代碼編輯器。如果你不知道從哪裡開始，這是一個很好的選擇。
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The most popular code editor. 最流行的代碼編輯器。However you need to install extensions such as [cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) or [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) to use AI. My personal experience is that it's not as good as Cursor at this stage.
- [bolt.new](https://bolt.new/) - good for quick prototyping.
- [v0](https://v0.dev/) - good for quick prototyping and UI design.

### Frontend (前端)
